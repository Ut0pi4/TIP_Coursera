# Tensorflow In Practice from Coursera

## Introduction
This project is done in the course Tensorflow In Practice from Coursera by Deeplearning.ai. From this course, I have learnt a lot about Tensorflow through practical implementation of projects.

The course is split in weeks, described as follows:
1. Introduction to TensorFlow
2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

## Certificate
This is my certificate of the course.
